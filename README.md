# cpp-poker-solver

This solver is incomplete. I am refactoring and cleaning up the code from this working solver: https://github.com/Fossana/cplusplus-cfr-poker-solver
Game tree building and equity calculations are working however. The equity calculations require the HandRanks.dat file that can be found here: https://github.com/christophschmalhofer/poker/blob/master/XPokerEval/XPokerEval.TwoPlusTwo/HandRanks.dat
